# Create a Simple Form in PHP

Before we can start building with PHP we should load the dependencies.

Dependencies in PHP are loaded with a special tool called composer[https://getcomposer.org/],
with composer you list the required libraries in a .json file after which they are loaded
and can be used.

### Load PHP dependencies with composer ###

Create a composer.json file and place the following contents inside:
    {
        "require": {
            "symfony/http-foundation": "3.3.9"
        }
    }

The above package is used for abstracting HTTP Request and Response which can be somewhat complicated in plain PHP.

To start things off we should include the following lines:

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

    $request = Request::createFromGlobals();

This provides us with needed abstractions to get the HTTP request values we need.
Instead of using global methods we can use the `$request` variable.
You can view more details on the HTTP Foundation page [https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation.html]

### Create a simple HTML page ###

Enter the following contents in index.php

    <html>

    <head>
    <title>PHP page</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    <p>
    This is a simple paragraph text.
    </p>

    <p>
        <form method="post" url="/post.php">

        <input type="text" name="firstName">

        <input type="text" name="secondName">

        </form>
    </p>

    </body>

    </html>

This page will be used as a starting page on which we will place a simple form for submission.

And enter the following contents in post.php

    <html>

    <head>
    <title>PHP Post page
    </head>
    <body>

    <?php

        use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

        $request = Request::createFromGlobals();

        $first_name = $request->get('firstName');

        $second_name = $request->get('secondName');

        echo "<h1>The first name is: " . $first_name . "\n" .
             "The second name is: " . $second_name . "<\h1>;

    ?php>

    </body>
    </html>

This is somewhat an unusual way of placing Symfony components inline but it will serve as a good example for those of you starting
 with composer coming from a plain PHP background.

The first page, index.php will display a simple page with a form that has input for first name and last name.
The second page, post.php will be used for getting the values posted from index.php and displaying them.
